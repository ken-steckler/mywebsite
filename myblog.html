  <h4>An Unexpected Journey</h3>
  <h5>March 29, 2021 - Entry #1</h5>
  <p>Hey everyone, my name is Ken. I'm currently a fulltime retail staff pharmacist and I am studying to become a full stack web developer.</p>
  <p>I started my journey back in December 2020 and have been putting in at least 1 hour of studying per day. In the last 3-4 months of self teaching, I've learned basic HTML, CSS and Javascript.
    I've also learned some backend languages such as Python and Java, as well as some frameworks like Django, React and Bootstrap.
    It has been an incredible year so far and I have learned a lot simply from self studying.
  <p>So why the change in career? Nothing against being a retail pharmacist but it isn't for me, and I didn't realize this until I actually started working as a pharmacist.
    Although I make stable income, I want to expand my horizons and personal growth and I feel like I can do that with web development.
    Like many self taught developers, I want to change careers. Simple as that.
  <p>As I continue to learn something new every day, I remind myself that this path will not be a walk in the park. I know that there will be obstacles I will have to face and choices I will have to make.
    However, I fell in love with the process. I love the challenges that come with being a web developer and I love
    seeing the end result.
  <p>Like I said, I know that it will not be easy, especially since I am self-taught. But I am confident in my abilities and I am excited to see what is in store in the future.
