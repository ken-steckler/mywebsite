        <h2>A little bit about myself...</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring web developer/software engineer with a focus on creating
          simple yet creative web sites and applications. <br>
        <p>I am familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript and front-end frameworks
          such as React to implement applications into websites. <br>
        <p>I am also learning how to code backend with Python and using Django as a framework,
          as well as using SQL for data. <br>
        <p>I have no technical degree and am self taught but I am dedicated and have
          been teaching myself something new every day since last year. <br>
        <p>Feel free to take a look below for some of my work!

        <h2>Google Clone Page</h2>
          <p>This was one of the first projects that I worked on from scratch.
            HTML and CSS were the only tools that were used to create this project.
            I plan to expand from this and be able to integrate more advanced features
            using JavaScript and Python code with Django. <br>
